Checkstyle Extension for BlueJ

This updates the BlueJ Checkstyle Extension (http://bluejcheckstyle.sourceforge.net) to work with BlueJ 4.1, Checkstyle 8.3, and Java 1.8.

Contact with the author indicates a desire to rehost and maintain the original project.

The intent of this project is to tide over the user community to tide until such rehosting. Thus, minimal modifications to the original source have been made as necessary to support the current environment.

Primary contributors to this project are students enrolled in the Fall 2017 semester of CS4250, Software Engineering Principles, at Metropolitan State University of Denver.
