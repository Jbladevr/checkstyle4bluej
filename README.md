Checkstyle Extension for BlueJ

This updates the *BlueJ Checkstyle Extension* (http://bluejcheckstyle.sourceforge.net) to work with BlueJ **4.1**, Checkstyle **8.3**, and Java **1.8**.

The author of the original extension indicates a desire to rehost and maintain the original project.  The intent of this repository is to tide over the user community until those activities can take place.  Thus, only minimal modifications to original sources have been made for the current environment.

Primary contributors to this updating effort were students enrolled in the Fall 2017 semester of CS4250, *Software Engineering Principles,* at [Metropolitan State University of Denver](msudenver.edu).
