Checkstyle Extension for BlueJ

This updates the *BlueJ Checkstyle Extension* (http://bluejcheckstyle.sourceforge.net) to work with BlueJ **4.1**, Checkstyle **8.4**, and Java **1.8**.

The original author of the extension indicates a desire to rehost and maintain the project.  The intent of this repository is to tide over the user community until those activities can take place.  Thus, minimal modifications to original sources and documentation have been made, as necessary for the current environment.

Primary contributors to *this updating effort* were students enrolled in the Fall 2017 semester of [CS4250](http://www.jodypaul.com/cs/sweprin/), *Software Engineering Principles,* at [Metropolitan State University of Denver](http://www.msudenver.edu).
